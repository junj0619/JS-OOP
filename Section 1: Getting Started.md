### 1.What is OOP? ###

#### What is Object-oriented Programming(OOP)? ####

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular programming paradigm or style of programming. It’s been around since ‘70s, but unlike tools and frameworks that come and go, OOP is still very relevant today. That’s because it’s not a programming language or a tool. It’s a style of programming.
  

#### Why learn OOP? #### 

OOP helps you manage and reduce complexity in software by building re-usable building blocks (objects). Properly designed objects provide a simple interface and hide the unnecessary complexity from the outside, just like a DVD player! A DVD player has a complex logic board on the inside and a few buttons on the outside. When you press the play button, you don’t care how all those microchips talk to each other.


#### Object-oriented programming helps you: #### 

* Manage and reduce complexity
* Eliminate redundant code
* Build re-usable building blocks
* Write cleaner code


### 2.Four Pillars of OOP? ###

Before Object-Oriented Programming, We had procedure programmming divided a program into a set of fucntions. so you have data stored in a bunch of variables and functions that operate on the data. This style of programming is very simple and straight forward but as your programs grow, you end up with a bunch of functions that all over the place. You might find yourself copying and pasting line of codes over and over to make a change to one function and then several other functions break. That's what people call spaghetti code, there is so much interdependency in all these functions it becomes problematic.   

Object-Oriented Programming came to sovle this problem, in  Object-Oriented Programming we combine a group of related variables and functions into a unit. We call that unit an object. We refer to these variable to properties, and the functions as methods.

#### Abstraction ####

#### Inheritance ####

#### Polymorphism ####
